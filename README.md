# Hive-FdF
This Wireframe project is about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape.
"Wireframe" = fils de fer in French, hence the name of the project.

## Objectives
In this project you will discover the basics of graphic programming, and in particular how
to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to
observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.

You will also discover your first graphic library: miniLibX. This library was developed
internally and includes the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal
with events linked to this window: keyboard and mouse. This project introduces you to
“events” programming. 

This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french,
hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points
(x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as
a parameter to your program.
